== Introduction

FlashCards is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their notes*.
More importantly, FlashCards is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FlashCards can let you retrieve and access your notes for various subjects faster than sieving through your hardcopied notes. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashcard.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for this FlashCard application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Other example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all flashcards
* **`add`**`t/Pythagoras Theorem diff/1 c/a^2 + b^2 = c^2 d/30-03-2019 s/Math`

Adds a flashcard named `Pythagoras Theorem` under the subject `Math` to the list of flashcards.
It has a difficulty level of `1` with the content `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` and should be memorised by `30-03-2019`.

* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd flashcard shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
e.g. in `add t/TOPIC`, `TOPIC` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Pythagoras Theorem`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TOPIC c/CONTENT`, `c/CONTENT t/TOPIC` is also acceptable.
