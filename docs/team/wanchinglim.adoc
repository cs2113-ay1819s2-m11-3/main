== PROJECT: FlashCards

---

== Overview

This portfolio serves as a documentation of my contributions to a desktop application my team and I developed in a software engineering module.
The team consists of 3 members and the application was developed over the course of 6 weeks.
Due to project constraints, the team needed to start from an existing code base (https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[addressbook-level4])
and the user has to interact with the application mainly through the Command Line Interface (CLI).
However, the user can also interact with the application through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is created with JavaFX.
The entire application is written in Java and has about 10k lines of code.

Our developed application is titled *FlashCards*.
FlashCards is a desktop application that targets mainly secondary school students to help them memorise their notes.
It further serves as a notes management platform by helping them organize all their notes based on the different subjects they have.

My role was to develop the *GUI* and *tagging* feature.
The following sections will depict my contributions in greater detail, as well as the relevant sections I have documented in our user and developer guide based on these enhancements.

== Summary of Contributions

This section will document the summary of features that I have coded, other helpful contributions to this project, and documentation done for this application.
An overview of all my contributed code can be found https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=wanchinglim&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-14&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[here].

=== Major Enhancement: GUI
** *What it does:* It allows the user to click a subject and only flashcards belonging to that subject will be listed.
** *Justification*: This feature helps users access their notes for any subject with just a click.
Since the flashcards are categorized based on their subject, users will be able to focus on a particular subject's notes when studying.
** *Highlights:* This enhancement affects the existing GUI and `add` command.
It helps the user to automatically categorize their flashcards based on the subject without any additional steps.
As such, not only will notes pertaining to each subject be easily available to the user, it also offers a better user experience and increases their efficiency when studying for a subject.
Furthermore, no separate storage is needed even though the list of subjects is seemingly saved every time the user exits.
The subject panel will still contain the list of subjects that existed before the user exited the application.
** *Code contributed:*  Pull Requests https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/73[#73] and https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/94[#94]

=== Minor Enhancement: Tagging Feature
** *What is it:* Added colours to each subject tag so that different tags will have different colours.
** *Justification:* This helps users to differentiate flashcards better based on the subject tag colour when all flashcards are listed.
** *Code contributed:* Pull Request https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-m11-3/main/pull/6[#6]

== Contributions to The User Guide

|===
|_Given the original user guide of the existing code base, we did extensive modifications and tailored it to suit our application.
The following is an excerpt of our user guide that I documented, mainly the `add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `select` commands._

== Contributions to The Developer Guide

|===
|_Given the original developer guide of the existing code base, we modified various sections and tailored it to suit our application.
This guide contains all information regarding the development of this application, and the following will show an excerpt of it that was written by me.
I took charge of the **Quizzing by Subject** section since it was the feature I developed for this project._
